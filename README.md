Digital Will
Project Description
Digital Will is a blockchain-based smart contract system that enables users to create and manage their digital wills on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform allows users to securely store funds and define beneficiaries who will automatically receive their designated inheritance after a specified inactivity period. This decentralized approach ensures transparency, immutability, and automatic execution without the need for traditional legal intermediaries.
The smart contract implements a proof-of-life mechanism where will owners must periodically "check in" to prove they are still active. If the owner fails to check in within the defined inactivity period, beneficiaries can execute the will and claim their designated shares.
Project Vision
Our vision is to revolutionize estate planning by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and accessible digital inheritance system. We aim to:

Democratize Estate Planning: Make will creation accessible to everyone, regardless of geographical location or financial status
Eliminate Intermediaries: Remove the need for lawyers, executors, and probate courts, reducing costs and delays
Ensure Transparency: Provide immutable records of inheritance intentions that cannot be disputed or altered
Automate Execution: Enable automatic distribution of assets based on predefined conditions
Global Accessibility: Create a borderless solution that works across jurisdictions

By combining the security of blockchain with the practicality of smart contracts, Digital Will aims to be the future of digital inheritance management.
Key Features
1. Will Creation

Users can create a personalized digital will with a custom inactivity period
Set the timeframe after which the will becomes executable if no check-in occurs
One will per Ethereum address ensures simplicity and security

2. Beneficiary Management

Add multiple beneficiaries with specific share percentages
Flexible distribution: allocate anywhere from 1% to 100% to each beneficiary
Smart validation ensures total shares don't exceed 100%
Transparent beneficiary records stored immutably on-chain

3. Proof-of-Life Check-In System

Will owners can perform regular check-ins to reset the inactivity timer
Simple function call proves the owner is still active
Prevents premature execution of the will
Flexible check-in schedule based on user preference

4. Secure Fund Management

Deposit Ether directly into the smart contract
Funds are locked securely until will execution
Transparent tracking of total deposited amounts
No withdrawal mechanism ensures commitment to beneficiaries

5. Automatic Will Execution

Anyone can trigger will execution once the inactivity period expires
Automatic distribution to all beneficiaries based on their share percentages
Trustless execution without need for third-party intervention
Event logging for complete transparency

6. Query Functions

Check will details including total funds and execution status
View all beneficiaries and their respective shares
Verify if a will is ready for execution
Public visibility ensures transparency

Future Scope
Short-term Enhancements

Multi-Asset Support: Extend beyond Ether to support ERC-20 tokens and NFTs
Emergency Contacts: Allow designated contacts to initiate early verification checks
Partial Withdrawals: Enable owners to withdraw funds before execution with beneficiary consent
Will Amendments: Allow modifications to beneficiaries and shares with proper safeguards

Medium-term Development

Time-locked Distributions: Staggered payouts to beneficiaries over time (e.g., monthly installments)
Conditional Inheritances: Set specific conditions for beneficiaries (age requirements, milestones)
Multi-signature Control: Require multiple signatures for will execution
Oracle Integration: Connect with real-world data sources for enhanced verification
Mobile Application: User-friendly mobile interface for managing wills

Long-term Vision

Cross-chain Compatibility: Support for multiple blockchain networks
Legal Framework Integration: Partner with legal systems for hybrid digital-physical wills
Identity Verification: Integration with decentralized identity systems (DIDs)
AI-powered Suggestions: Smart recommendations for beneficiary allocation
Insurance Integration: Connect with life insurance policies for comprehensive estate planning
DAO Governance: Community-driven decision-making for protocol upgrades
Privacy Features: Zero-knowledge proofs for confidential will details

Additional Features

Dispute Resolution: Decentralized arbitration mechanism for contested wills
Charity Integration: Easy donation options to registered charities
Tax Optimization: Smart contract logic to handle tax implications
Family Trees: Visual representation of inheritance chains across generations
Backup Executors: Designate trusted parties to facilitate execution if needed
